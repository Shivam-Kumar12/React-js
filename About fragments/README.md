# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

**In React, a fragment is a way to group multiple elements without introducing an additional DOM element. Fragments were introduced in React 16.2 to solve the problem of having to add unnecessary wrapper div elements when you want to return multiple elements from a component.**

**_The empty angle brackets (<> and </>) are shorthand for fragments. You can also use the full <React.Fragment> syntax if you need to provide a key or other props to the fragment._**
